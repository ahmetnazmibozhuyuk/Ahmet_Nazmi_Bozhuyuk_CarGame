To add a new level; simply duplicate a level prefab, assign the 
enter-exit point of each iteration from the class in the prefab's
first child and drag the created prefab into the LevelPrefabs list
in the LevelManager.

I used a simple ICrash interface for any types of collisions
(like end goal, obstacles or pre recorded cars) so that I can 
expand on interactables easier.

I was initially planning on using a ScriptableObject to hold level
data and prefab but eventually decided to hold it in LevelStartGoalPoints class.
With this level prefab system, I was able to create new levels easily.
